Hello!

Thanks for testing my app!

It is a tool for musicians to play around with rhythm,
baselines and chords in a live setting.
Before you try it, check this video as an introduction.
It is an introduction both when it comes to what the app is and how it can be used.

Now download the app and have fun with it!

# Download

In order to download the app, make sure you visit this page on the phone where you want to download it.
Then use the buttons at the top of this page.

In the app there is a little info link in the top right cornder.
You can use this to check the version of the app you currently have installed on your phone,
in order to make sure you have the most up to date version. The latest versnio of the app is:

Eventually the app will be in the iOS and Android app stores, like any normal app. However, I'm not at the
stage yet where the app is smooth enough to be placed there. The way to get there is to have a select few
people test it first, and this is where you come in. This means that the installation is not as smooth as it
eventually will be. Please be prepared for a few extra steps!

# Notes for Android users

For Android users, you need to first enable installation of apps from unknown sources. Please see 
[this link](https://www.applivery.com/docs/troubleshooting/android-unknown-sources/) for information on how
to do this. The app then comes as an .apk file, and upon downloading it you should be prompted to install it.
For more information on .apk files in general, please see
[this link](https://www.androidpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file).

# Notes for iOS users

Since the app is not yet released on the iOS app store, I need to set up my build process for the app so that it can be ran on your phone. In order to do this, I need the UDID of your phone. Please find the UDID of your phone and send it to me, and I will notify you when a version is ready that is enabled for your phone. You can use this site to find your UDID:

<https://get.udid.io/>

And here is a video explaining how to do the same:

# What's next?

After testing the app, please reach ou to me! I would love to hear about your experience.
Specifically, I would like to know:

1. What features would be needed for the app to be useful to you?
2. Was there something that was dificult to understand, so it needs to be explained better before I go live?

Very excited to have you as a part of the testing team!
